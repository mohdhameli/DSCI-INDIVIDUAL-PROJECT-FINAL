    "### (1) Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "We work with two connected data sets: `players.csv` (one row per player) and `sessions.csv` (one row per play session). `players.csv` has 196 players and 7 variables. `sessions.csv` has 1,535 sessions. Both the tables use `hashedEmail` as an anonymous player ID so we can join.\n",
    "\n",
    "**players.csv (one row per player)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hashedEmail`: text ID, one per player  \n",
    "- `subscribe`: TRUE/FALSE, if the player signed up for the newsletter  \n",
    "- `Age`: numeric, age in years (mean ≈ 21.14, 2 missing)  \n",
    "- `gender`: categorical, self-reported  \n",
    "- `name`: text, first name  \n",
    "- `experience`: categorical (Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Veteran, Pro)  \n",
    "- `played_hours`: numeric, total hours played (mean ≈ 5.85)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**sessions.csv (one row per session)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hashedEmail`: text ID, links session to player  \n",
    "- `start_time`, `end_time`: text time stamps (`DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM`)  \n",
    "- `original_start_time`, `original_end_time`: numeric server time stamps  \n",
    "\n",
    "From `sessions.csv` we create:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `session_minutes`: length of each session in minutes  \n",
    "- Per player: `total_playtime_min` (sum of session_minutes),  \n",
    "  `avg_session_min` (mean session length),  \n",
    "  `session_count` (number of sessions)\n",
    "\n",
    "From 6 April–26 September 2024 there are 125 players with at least one session and 71 players with no sessions.\n",

    "**Issues we can see**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing values (age and some end times) and a few sessions with NA or zero duration  \n",
    "- Strong skew in playtime (a few players play a lot more than others)  \n",
    "- Possible mismatch between text times and server times  \n",
    "\n",

    "- Join these measures to `players.csv` by `hashedEmail` so that we only have one tidy row per player  \n",
    "- Use `subscribe` as the response (TRUE/FALSE) and the engagement and the profile variables as predictors\n",

    "- Read both CSV files and check their structure  \n",

    "\n",
    "For graphs, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plot a histogram of `Age`  \n",
    "- Plot a histogram of `played_hours`  \n",
    "- Make a boxplot of `total_playtime_min` by `experience`  \n",
    "- Make a bar chart of mean `total_playtime_min` by `subscribe`  \n",
    "\n",
    "These plots help us see how age and experience are spread in the sample, how skewed playtime is, and if the newsletter subscribers seem to play more and have more sessions than non-subscribers.\n"

    "\n",
    "The boxplot of `total_playtime_min` by `experience` suggests that more experienced players (for example, Regular, Veteran, Pro) tend to have higher total playtime, even though the data is spread inside each group. The bar chart of mean `total_playtime_min` by `subscribe` shows that newsletter subscribers on average play more than non-subscribers.\n",

    "### (4) Methods and plan\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome we are looking for is newsletter subscription (`subscribe`), which is TRUE/FALSE. That's why we plan to use **logistic regression**. The predictors will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Engagement features: `total_playtime_min`, `avg_session_min`, `session_count`  \n",
    "- Player information: `Age`, `gender`, `experience`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a great fit here because it is made for binary outcomes and gives us clear effects (how each variable changes the chance of subscribing). It is also a standard method we can explain easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each player is independent  \n",
    "- The relationship between predictors and the log odds of subscribing is not extremely non-linear  \n",
    "- There are not too many tiny groups (for example, rare experience levels)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations are that logistic regression can struggle with strong outliers, very skewed predictors, or very complex patterns that are not even close to linear on the log-odds scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "For model selection, we plan to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the data once into 70% training and 30% test at the **player** level  \n",
    "- On the training set, use k-fold cross-validation to compare a few models  \n",
    "  (for example, a simple logistic model vs. a model with more interactions or a penalised version)  \n",
    "- Choose the final model based on performance on the validation folds, then report its accuracy on the test set  \n"
